##Introduction
The <span style="color:CRIMSON">data.table</span> package for R is the brainchild of two heavy data users in R, one (Matt Dowle) from the financial industry, and one (Arun Srinivasan) from genomics. Both using large amounts of data, and finding ways to code things to go faster and more efficiently.

<br>
A data.table is like data.frame *plus*. In fact it is also a data.frame, meaning whatever code you use on a data.frame (including dplyr or other tidyverse code) works fine on data.table objects.

<br>
I am not going to discuss the differences between data.table and dplyr or try to convince you one is better than the other. To learn more about that, click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly/27840349#27840349), [here](https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/09/a-speed-test-comparison-of-plyr-data-table-and-dplyr/), or google it. `r emo::ji("smile")`

<br>
One notable difference with data.table is that column definitions or modifications and calculations are made using assignment by reference. In the internals of R, when a new column is made (for instance with mutate from dplyr), the entire table is copied to add it. This can be expensive from a memory (and thus speed) perspective when R is working with larger files. Instead, the data.table approach is to make a reference which is similar to an index, which tells R how to calculate the field when it is needed, rather than make a copy of the table to have it immediately available.

<br>
Some of the following examples come from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

##Getting Started

####Setting a data.table
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
data(iris)
iris <- setDT(iris) #changes a data.frame to a data.table
class(iris)
```
Another option is to read in your csv file with <span style="color:CRIMSON">fread()</span>, which stands for 'fast read' and is similar to read.table or read.csv, or you can use it to read a text file off the internet!
Here's a [csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/arunsrinivasan/flights/NYCflights14/flights14.csv) file living on the interwebs.

```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/arunsrinivasan/flights/NYCflights14/flights14.csv")
flights
```

<br>

####Using a data.table
The overarching concept of data.table is “i, j, by.”

<img src="images/i.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
flights[carrier == "AA" & origin == "JFK"] #print all flights with AA and had origin of JFK
ggplot(flights[carrier == "AA"], aes(x = distance)) +
  geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
```


<img src="images/j.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />
This is where things get more interesting.

#####Selecting Columns
```{r}
head(flights[, arr_delay]) #returns the column as a vector
flights[, .(arr_delay, dep_delay)] #.() is an alias for list(), returns a data table
flights[, .(delayed_arrival = arr_delay,
            delayed_depart = dep_delay)] #print with new names

flights[, .(delayed_arrival_mean = mean(arr_delay),
            delayed_depart_mean = mean(dep_delay))] #summarize the DT, include new names
```

####Calculations and Assigning New Variables
```{r}
flights[carrier == "AA", sum(air_time)]
flights[, totalDelay := dep_delay + arr_delay] #assigns a new variable, doesn't print anything
head(flights)

flights[month == 1 & flight == 3, origin := "Becca"] #reassigns the 'origin' variable
head(flights[month == 1 & flight == 3])

flights[, `:=`(dep_time = dep_time + 1,
               sdDelay = sd(totalDelay))] #assign multiple variables at a time
head(flights)

flights[, resids := residuals(lm(totalDelay ~ 1))]
head(flights)
```

<img src="images/by.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />

####Grouping
```{r}
flights[carrier == "AA", .(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)), by = dest]
```

####Joining
As we've seen, *i* can be a filtering statement, but it can also be another data.table we can merge with. The following table comes from [here](https://rstudio-pubs-static.s3.amazonaws.com/52230_5ae0d25125b544caab32f75f0360e775.html) and summarizes different joins and their syntax.
<img src="images/join.png" height="800px" width="1000px"/>

```{r}
X <- data.table(ID = c(1:10), color = rep(c("red", "blue"), times = 5))
X 
Y <- data.table(ID = c(3, 4, 12, 5, 30), z = c(45, 23, 6, 43, 23))
Y

X[Y, on = "ID"] #right outer join
Y[X, on = "ID"] #left outer join

Y[X, on = "ID", nomatch = 0] #inner join
```

**setnames()** change names of variables
```{r}
setnames(flights, c("year", "month"), c("Yr", "Mo"))
head(names(flights))
```

**setkey()** orders a data.table by a variable
```{r}
setkey(flights, year, month, day)
setkey(X, color)
X 
```

**.N** counts the rows of a data table, for use in i or j
```{r}
flights[, .N] #same as nrow(flights)
flights[, .N, by = carrier] #count the number of rows for each carrier
flights[sample(.N, 5)] # randomly sample 5 rows 
```

**.I** equivalent to seq_len(nrow(x))
```{r}
DT <- data.table(x = c(sample(LETTERS[1:5], 10, TRUE), "A"),
                 num = round(rnorm(11, 20, 5), digits = 2),
                 key = "x")
DT
first_x <- DT[, .I[1], by=x] #find the first occurance by some group
first_x

DT[-first_x[, V1]] #get everything but the first occurance of each group by x
```

**.SD** **S**ubset of x's **D**ata for each group. Here's a [stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8508482/what-does-sd-stand-for-in-data-table-in-r?utm_medium=organic&utm_source=google_rich_qa&utm_campaign=google_rich_qa) with a good explanation.
```{r}
facs <- c("carrier", "origin", "dest") 
flights[, (facs) := lapply(.SD, factor), .SDcols = facs]
```
