##Introduction
The <span style="color:CRIMSON">data.table</span> package for R is the brainchild of two heavy data users in R, one (Matt Dowle) from the financial industry, and one (Arun Srinivasan) from genomics. Both using large amounts of data, and finding ways to code things to go faster and more efficiently.

<br>
A data.table is like data.frame *plus*. In fact it is also a data.frame, meaning whatever code you use on a data.frame (including dplyr or other tidyverse code) works fine on data.table objects.

<br>
I am not going to discuss the differences between data.table and dplyr or try to convince you one is better than the other. To learn more about that, click [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21435339/data-table-vs-dplyr-can-one-do-something-well-the-other-cant-or-does-poorly/27840349#27840349), [here](https://www.r-statistics.com/2013/09/a-speed-test-comparison-of-plyr-data-table-and-dplyr/), or google it. `r emo::ji("smile")`

Some of the following examples come from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/vignettes/datatable-intro.html).

##Getting Started

####Setting a data.table
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(data.table)
data(iris)
iris <- setDT(iris) #changes a data.frame to a data.table
class(iris)
```
Another option is to read in your csv file with <span style="color:CRIMSON">fread()</span>, which stands for 'fast read' and is similar to read.table or read.csv, or you can use it to read a text file off the internet!
```{r, cache = TRUE}
flights <- fread("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wiki/arunsrinivasan/flights/NYCflights14/flights14.csv")
flights
```

<br>

####Using a data.table
The overarching concept of data.table is “i, j, by.”

<img src="images/i.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />
```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, error = FALSE}
flights[carrier == "AA" & origin == "JFK"] #print all flights with AA and had origin of JFK
ggplot(flights[carrier == "AA"], aes(x = distance)) + geom_histogram() + theme_bw()
```


<img src="images/j.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />
This is where things get more interesting.

#####Selecting Columns
```{r}
head(flights[, arr_delay]) #returns the column as a vector
flights[, .(arr_delay, dep_delay)] #.() is an alias for list(), returns a data table
flights[, .(delayed_arrival = arr_delay, delpayed_depart = dep_delay)] #print with new names
flights[, .(delayed_arrival_mean = mean(arr_delay), delpayed_depart_mean = mean(dep_delay))]
```

####Calculations and Assigning New Variables
```{r}
flights[carrier == "AA", sum(air_time)]
flights[, totalDelay := dep_delay + arr_delay] #assigns a new variable, doesn't print anything
head(flights)

flights[month == 1 & flight == 3, origin := "Becca"] #reassigns the 'origin' variable
head(flights[month == 1 & flight == 3])

flights[, `:=`(dep_time = dep_time + 1, sdDelay = sd(totalDelay))] #assign multiple variables at a time
head(flights)

flights[, resids := residuals(lm(totalDelay ~ 1))]
head(flights)
```


<img src="images/by.png" height="800px" width="1000px" />

####Grouping
```{r}
flights[carrier == "AA", .(avg_dep_delay = mean(dep_delay)), by = dest]
```

####Joining

####Handy Functions

**setkey()** orders your data table by that variable. I often use this when working with longitudinal data to make sure the table is in chronologic order, but you can order by anything.
```{r}
setkey(flights, day, month, year)
key(flights)
```

**setnames()** change names of variables
```{r}
setnames(flights, c("year", "month"), c("Yr", "Mo"))
head(names(flights))
```

**.N** counts the rows of a data table, for use in i or j
```{r}
flights[, .N, by = carrier] #count the number of observations for each carrier
flights[sample(.N, 5)] # randomly sample 5 rows
```

**.I** equivalent to seq_len(nrow(x))
```{r}
flights[, index := .I, by = carrier] #create an index in each carrier
head(flights[carrier == "AA"])
head(flights[carrier == "AS"])
```

**.SD** specifies multiple columns in j
```{r}
facs <- c("carrier", "origin", "dest") 

flights[, .SD, .SDcols = facs]
flights[, (facs) := lapply(.SD, factor), .SDcols = facs]
```
